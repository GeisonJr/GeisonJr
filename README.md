# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Geison, but you can call me `GRO`

I'm a software developer with a passion for creating and sharing knowledge. I'm always looking for new challenges and eager to learn new technologies. I'm currently working as a Tech Lead at [HPro](https://github.com/hproinformatica), a software company specializing in ERP solutions. My main focus is on JavaScript/TypeScript, React, React Native and Delphi (yes, Delphi). I'm also a contributor to the [Docu](https://github.com/docu-wiki-br/docu) project, a wiki system for anything I'm very proud of.
